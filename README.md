# Embedded Design

Using this project, the child's parents can be informed of the condition of their child's room by having a mobile phone and connecting to the Internet, and if necessary, control it so that with the help of the Internet of Things, parents can illuminate the child's bedroom light. And also be aware of its temperature and humidity. In fact, more precisely, it means to adjust the brightness, turn on or off the light in the child's bedroom and increase or decrease the light produced by the lamp, and also by using a sensor we can observe the temperature and humidity of the child's bedroom and be aware of the situation of these two factors in the child's bedroom.

In this project, forconnecting to the Internet, we use the ESP8266-01 module, which has two GPIO (General-purpose input / output) ports, and we use both ports and set one port for the DHT11 sensor. Using this sensor, we receive environmental information, ie temperature and humidity, and we use the other port of this module for LED, and we adjust the brightness and turn on or off the child's bedroom light, which we can adjust the brightness automatically or manually. for controlling light automatically we use relays.

## Language
